# Distributed Payment System Prototype

Distributed Algorithms Class (CS-451) at EPFL, Fall 2018

### Goals
The goal of this practical project is to implement a prototype of a particular
distributed payment system. To this end, some underlying abstractions are
used:
 * Perfect Links (complete)
 * Uniform Reliable Broadcast (complete)
 * FIFO Broadcast (complete)
 * Localized Causal Broadcast (in progress)

The final payment system is build upon these lower-level abstractions.
